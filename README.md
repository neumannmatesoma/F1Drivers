# Overview
## Description
As part of a recent coursework assignment, I built a modern client-side web application using Preact, TypeScript, and a routing system to manage multiple views. The project focused on component-based architecture, type safety, and efficient rendering performance. Through this task, I deepened my understanding of lightweight front-end frameworks and improved my skills in building maintainable, scalable single-page applications.
## Technologies
